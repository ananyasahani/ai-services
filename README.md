# BERT Gig Recommendation Model - Streamlit App

This is a simple web-based demo application built with **Streamlit** that utilizes a **BERT-based model** to recommend freelance gigs based on a user's profile.

## üîó Web App

This recommendation service powers the web application developed for **Hack With Gujarat 2025**.

üöÄ **Try it live:** [v0-hwg.vercel.app](https://v0-hwg.vercel.app)

## üîç Overview

Freelancers can enter their **User ID**, and the app will analyze their skills and bio to recommend the most relevant freelance gigs. The recommendation is powered by **DistilBERT**, a lightweight version of BERT.

## üôÖ What the Freelancer Should Enter

* **User ID**: A unique identifier representing the freelancer.

  * The app uses a mock user database, so ensure your user ID exists (e.g., `freelancer1`).
  * Each user profile includes a `skills` list and a short `bio`.

## üß∞ How It Works

1. The app uses the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained `distilbert-base-uncased` model.
2. The user's profile (skills + bio) is converted into a BERT embedding.
3. Each gig is represented by an embedding of its title, description, and required skills.
4. Cosine similarity is calculated between the user's embedding and each gig embedding.
5. The top 5 most similar gigs are displayed as recommendations.

## üìä Example User

```json
freelancer1: {
  "id": "freelancer1",
  "skills": ["React", "Node.js", "JavaScript"],
  "bio": "Experienced full-stack developer with expertise in web applications"
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

Before running the app, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers torch numpy
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Save the Python script as `app.py`
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `app.py`
3. Run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. The browser will open the app at `http://localhost:8501`

## üìÑ Notes

* This is a **demo** and uses hardcoded mock data for both gigs and users.
* In a production version, user data and gigs would be retrieved from a real database.
* BERT embeddings are computed dynamically; depending on hardware, performance may vary.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Future Improvements

* Connect to a real backend database
* Add user authentication
* Allow user to update skills and bio in-app
* Use caching to reduce re-computation of embeddings
